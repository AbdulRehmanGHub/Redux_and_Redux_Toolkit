IMMER JS

// // We used immer js in (cartReducer.js) -- basically we have named the state to originalState first and then use produce method of immer js in which we have putter our complete switch method and return the produce method.

// // So, now the instead of changing our original state, there will be a new copy of state created and all the changing will occur inside it. Which will fast, optimize our website.

// // Now, we can change our code in mutating style (Mutable code means which change in real-time without changing/refreshing page). Like no need to use compilcated logics using map, filter, reduce methods again and again.
